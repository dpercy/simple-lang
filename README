Pure Functional Programming experiment:

- Every expression must either:
    - evaluate to a value
    - diverge
    - crash

- Goal 1: notebook
    - free-form like ipython
    - consistent like a spreadsheet
    - output shows each def/expr as "done", "running", or "crashed"

- Goal 2: alt backends
    - expandable debug trace
    - JS
    - asm.js or Webassembly
    - GLSL
-
