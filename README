Pure Functional Programming experiment:

- Every expression must either:
    - evaluate to a value
    - diverge
    - crash

- Goal 1: notebook
    - DONE free-form like ipython
    - DONE consistent like a spreadsheet
    - DONE output shows each def/expr as "done", "running", or "crashed"



- Goal 2: alt backends
    - expandable debug trace
    - JS
    - asm.js or Webassembly
    - GLSL




- Goal 3: conventional syntax
    - infix math
    - conventional f(x, y) function calls
    - infix "=" for definitions

    - implementing this parser in the lang itself would
      avoid having to reimplement it
